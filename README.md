## Synopsis

Verify if a value seems or is a logger, including "standardized" methods: `debug`, `info`, `error`... - _as [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) or [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)_.

## Usage 

```
   const isLogger = require('is-logger');
   const bunyan = require('bunyan');
   
   const LOG = bunyan.createLogger({name: __filename});
   const FAKE_LOG = {name: 'I am a fake logger!"};
   
   console.log(isLogger(LOG)) 
   # > return true: LOG is a logger.
   
   console.log(isLogger(FAKE_LOG);
   # > return false: FAKE_LOG is not a logger.
   
   console.log(isLogger(FAKE_LOG, {throwOnFalse: true});
   # > throw an error of type `IsNotLoggerError`: FAKE_LOG is not a logger.
   
```
